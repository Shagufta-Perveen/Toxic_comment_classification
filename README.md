Toxic Comment Classification Challenge
This project is based on the Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification Challenge on Kaggle. The goal is to build a multi-label text classification model that detects different types of toxicity in online comments.

üß† Problem Statement
Given a comment, the model classifies it into one or more categories of harmful language.

Toxicity Categories
The model targets the following six types of toxicity:

toxic: General disrespectful behavior.

severe_toxic: Highly offensive language.

obscene: Obscene or vulgar language.

threat: Expressing intent to harm.

insult: Direct personal attacks.

identity_hate: Targeted attacks based on identity.

üìÇ Dataset
The dataset contains text comments extracted from Wikipedia‚Äôs talk page edits, with binary labels for each category of toxicity. The dataset is split into:

train.csv ‚Äî Labeled data used for training.

test.csv ‚Äî Unlabeled data used for final predictions.

‚öôÔ∏è Workflow
The analysis follows a classic NLP workflow:

Data Exploration and Analysis

Text Preprocessing: Cleaning, stemming (Porter Stemmer), and English stopwords removal.

Feature Extraction: Generating numerical features using TF-IDF Vectorization (with (1, 2) N-gram range and 10,000 max features).

Model Training: Training multiple classifiers using the OneVsRestClassifier strategy for multi-label classification.

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

XGBoost

Model Evaluation: Assessing performance using Macro F1-score and 3-fold Cross-Validation (CV).

üì¶ Libraries Used
The core analysis relies on standard machine learning and data science libraries:

pandas, numpy

sklearn (Scikit-learn)

xgboost

nltk (Natural Language Toolkit)

üìä Results
Multiple machine learning models were trained and evaluated using the Macro F1-score on cross-validation. The preprocessing and TF-IDF features created a solid baseline.

The cross-validation scores revealed that the simpler, linear model provided the most stable and highest out-of-sample performance.

data/: Contains train.csv and test.csv datasets (if included).

README.md: Project description and results summary.

üìå Notes
NLTK resources like stopwords must be downloaded before running the preprocessing step.

The code supports Kaggle environments but can be modified for local execution.

‚è≠Ô∏è Future Improvements
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the Logistic Regression model using GridSearchCV.

Advanced Feature Engineering: Integrate pre-trained language models like BERT to use contextual embeddings for improved semantic understanding.

Deep Learning: Explore recurrent or convolutional neural networks (RNNs/CNNs) for sequence classification.
